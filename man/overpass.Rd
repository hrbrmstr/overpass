\title{Tools to Work with the OpenStreetMap (OSM) Overpass API}
\description{
The Overpass API (or OSM3S) is a read-only API that serves up custom
selected parts of the OSM map data. It acts as a database over the web:
the client sends a query to the API and gets back the data set that
corresponds to the query.\cr
\cr
Unlike the main API, which is optimized for editing, Overpass API is
optimized for data consumers that need a few elements within a glimpse
or up to roughly 100 million elements in some minutes, both selected by
search criteria like e.g. location, type of objects, tag properties,
proximity, or combinations of them. It acts as a database backend for
various services.\cr
\cr
Overpass API has a powerful query language (language guide, language
reference, an IDE) beyond XAPI, but also has a compatibility layer to
allow a smooth transition from XAPI.
